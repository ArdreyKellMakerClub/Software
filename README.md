# Software Coding Page
This is the page that we will be using to code things.
Since most of you don't know how to code, Java will be the language of choice.

## Why Java?
Honestly? It's syntax is easy, it's a good start, and kinda like C#
Also if you need help, you can ask Mrs.Robinson, the AP Comp Sci Principals teacher.

## Programs You Need
We will start off with using BlueJ. Then either NetBeans or Eclipse.
Maybe XCode. Or CodeBlocks.
Also remind me to teach someone who is not a senior that will continue this club HTML. Cause someone needs to maintain the website.
